# MASTERMIND.md
Overview

The mastermind folder within the easyAGI project serves the core orchestration modules, managing various agents and ensuring they operate cohesively to achieve the AGI's goals. mastermind coordinates the lifecycle of agents, integrates reasoning capabilities, and monitors system health.

# mastermind.py

The mastermind.py module is the central orchestrator for agency within the easyAGI framework. It manages agent lifecycles, monitors system health, and integrates components to ensure smooth operations.

Key Features:

    Auto-Configuration: Automatically sets up configuration files and directories.
    Agent Management: Provides a base class (AgentBase) for defining agents and a MASTERMIND class for managing agent lifecycles.
    Resource Monitoring and Self-Healing: Monitors system resources and performs self-healing actions if necessary.
    Data Accumulation and Validation: Collects and validates data from agents, storing it for further use.
    Integration: Integrates with components like SimpleCoder to extend functionality.

Example Usage:

    Initialize MASTERMIND and load agents.
    Integrate SimpleCoder and execute agents.
    Monitor resources and perform self-healing if needed.

# SimpleCoder.py

Purpose:
The SimpleCoder.py module defines a coding agent that can generate code snippets in various programming languages. It leverages reasoning capabilities from the automindx.bdi and automind.agi modules.

Key Features:

    Supported Languages: Includes a wide range of programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Bash, Perl, HTML, CSS, Three.js, Solidity, PyTeal, and Scilla.
    Task Execution: Validates inputs and generates code snippets for tasks like "hello_world".
    Activity Logging: Logs all activities and interactions, saving them to a JSON file.
    Integration with AGI: Initializes and integrates AGI components for enhanced reasoning and decision-making.



# SimpleCoder Class

    Initialization: Sets up supported languages, activity logging, and AGI integration.
    Methods:
        initialize_agi(): Initializes AGI components using API keys.
        validate_input(): Validates the input language and task.
        execute_task(): Generates code snippets based on the language and task.
        save_log(): Saves the activity log to a JSON file.
        load_log(): Loads the activity log from a JSON file.

# MASTERMIND Class

    Initialization: Sets up agents and BDI model.
    Methods:
        create_agent(): Creates a new agent with specified beliefs, desires, and intentions.
        delete_agent(): Deletes an existing agent.
        export_agent(): Exports an agent's configuration to a file.
        import_agent(): Imports an agent's configuration from a file.
        display_ui(): Provides a console UI for interacting with agents.

    Use MASTERMIND to create, manage, and interact with agents.

    Integration with Other Components:

    self_healing.py: Ensures system health by monitoring resources and performing self-healing actions.
    bdi.py: Implements the BDI model for managing beliefs, desires, and intentions.
    agi.py: Provides AGI components for enhanced reasoning and decision-making.

By integrating these components, mastermind.py orchestrates the entire AGI system, ensuring agents operate efficiently, resources are monitored, and self-healing mechanisms are in place to maintain system health.
