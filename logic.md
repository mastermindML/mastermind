# Logic Module Documentation

## Overview
The `logic.py` module is integral to the MASTERMIND project, providing the foundational framework for formal logic systems and operations. It enables the system to structure its reasoning processes, ensuring clear, consistent, and logical decision-making throughout the project.

## Features
- **Logical Operations**: Implements fundamental logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and implications, facilitating complex logical reasoning.
- **Predicate Logic**: Supports predicate logic, allowing the system to deal with variables and quantify statements, enhancing its reasoning capabilities.
- **Proof System**: Incorporates a proof system to validate arguments and infer new information based on a set of premises and rules of inference.

## Usage
Utilize the Logic module in any component of the MASTERMIND framework that requires structured logical reasoning. It's particularly useful in areas such as decision-making, problem-solving, and data analysis.

## Example Implementation
```python
class LogicalOperator:
    def AND(self, a, b):
        return a and b

    def OR(self, a, b):
        return a or b

    def NOT(self, a):
        return not a

    def IMPLIES(self, a, b):
        return not a or b
```

## Integration Guide
To integrate the Logic module, import it into your system and leverage the provided classes and functions to construct logical expressions and arguments. Use the logical operations to structure the reasoning processes within your application.

## Conclusion
The `logic.py` module is a cornerstone of the MASTERMIND project, underpinning its ability to reason and make decisions in a logical and structured manner. Its comprehensive support for logical operations and predicate logic makes it an invaluable resource for building intelligent, rational systems.
