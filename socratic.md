# Socratic Module Documentation

## Overview
The `socratic.py` module embodies the Socratic method's principles, emphasizing critical thinking and a questioning approach. It facilitates deep analytical discussions and problem-solving within the MASTERMIND framework by generating questions that explore complex ideas and uncover underlying assumptions.

## Features
- **Question Generation**: Dynamically generates questions based on the given context or subject matter, encouraging a deeper exploration and understanding.
- **Critical Thinking**: Aids in identifying assumptions, biases, and logical fallacies within arguments, promoting rigorous analysis and evaluation.
- **Dialogue Management**: Efficiently manages conversational threads to ensure focused and productive discussions.

## Usage
Integrate the Socratic module in areas of the MASTERMIND framework where analytical discussion and decision-making processes are crucial. It can be particularly useful in enhancing the system's ability to understand complex issues and facilitate learning.

## Example Implementation
```python
class SocraticQuestioner:
    def __init__(self, topic):
        self.topic = topic

    def generate_question(self):
        # Logic to generate a question based on the topic
        return "What are the underlying assumptions?"
```

## Integration Guide
To leverage the Socratic module, import it into your project, instantiate the `SocraticQuestioner` with the relevant topics, and utilize the `generate_question` method to stimulate critical discussions.

## Conclusion
`Socratic.py` is a vital component of the MASTERMIND project, enhancing its analytical and problem-solving capabilities by applying the Socratic method's dialectical approach to questioning and critical thinking.
