# Prediction Module Documentation

## Overview
The `prediction.py` module within the MASTERMIND project is designed to forecast future events and outcomes based on historical data and patterns. It employs various predictive models and algorithms to provide data-driven insights, enhancing the system's decision-making capabilities.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes historical data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform future predictions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes statistical models and machine learning algorithms to forecast future events and outcomes.
- **Decision Support**: Provides actionable insights and recommendations to support informed decision-making based on predictive analysis.

## Usage
Integrate the Prediction module into components of the MASTERMIND framework where forecasting and future planning are crucial. It can significantly contribute to areas such as strategic planning, risk management, and operational optimization.

## Example Implementation
```python
class Predictor:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def forecast(self, data):
        # Logic to apply the predictive model to data and generate forecasts
        return "Forecasted Outcome"
```

## Integration Guide
To leverage the Prediction module, import it into your system, select an appropriate predictive model for your domain, and instantiate the `Predictor` class with this model. Use the `forecast` method to generate predictions based on your data.

## Conclusion
The `prediction.py` module is a key asset in the MASTERMIND project, providing the capability to anticipate future scenarios and make data-informed decisions. Its integration facilitates proactive planning and strategic decision-making across various applications.
